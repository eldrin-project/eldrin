## Software Platform Requirements

### Core Platform Requirements

1. **Modular Architecture:**
  * **Pluggability:** The platform should be designed to allow for the seamless addition of new functionalities through modular addons.
  * **Dependency Management:** A robust dependency management system should be in place to handle dependencies between modules.
  * **Adding Modules:** There will be two types of modules: core modules that are essential for the platform's operation and custom modules that provide additional features and/or override core module functionality.

2. **Application Structure:**
  * **Modular Applications:** The platform should support the creation of complex applications composed of multiple modules.
  * **Dependency-Based Functionality:** Modules should be able to expose functionality to other modules, creating a layered architecture.

3. **Module Installation and Activation:**
  * **Manifest-Driven Installation:** Module installation should be driven by a manifest file containing metadata about the module.
  * **Database Schema and Data Migration:** The platform should automatically handle database schema changes and data migration during module installation.
  * **Role and Permission Management:** The platform should provide mechanisms for defining roles, permissions, and user access controls.
  * **UI Configuration:** Module-specific UI configurations should be stored in the database and loaded dynamically.

4. **UI Framework:**
  * **Component-Based UI:** The UI should be built using a component-based architecture to promote reusability and customization.
  * **Configuration-Driven UI:** The platform should allow for the configuration of UI elements through declarative means.
  * **Custom Component Development:** The platform should provide a mechanism for developers to create custom UI components.

5. **Convention Over Configuration:**
  * **Default Behaviors:** The platform should provide sensible default behaviors for common scenarios.
  * **Customizable Defaults:** Developers should be able to override default behaviors through configuration.

6. **Rapid Application Development:**
  * **Entity-Based UI Generation:** The platform should automatically generate standard UI components (lists, forms, etc.) based on entity definitions.
  * **Customizable UI:** Developers should be able to customize the generated UI to meet specific requirements.

### Technical Considerations

1. **Backend:**
  * **Rust:** Leverage Rust's performance, reliability, and safety for the backend implementation.
  * **Database:** Use PostgreSQL for its robust features and scalability.
  * **ORM:** Consider using an ORM like Diesel or SQLx to simplify database interactions.
  * **API:** Design a RESTful API to expose the platform's functionality to frontend and other clients.

2. **Frontend:**
  * Frontend can use any technology, the UI should use the manifest files to render the UI components. The UI should be able to render the components based on the configuration from the manifest files. The UI will be built as separate project and it is not yet in scope.
  * **Angular:** A good choice for complex web applications.
  * **React or Vue:** Consider these alternatives if they better suit the purpose.
  * **Flutter:** Consider using Flutter for mobile/desktop/web applications.
  * **State Management:** Implement a state management solution like NgRx or Redux to manage complex application state.

### Additional Considerations

* **Security:** Implement robust security measures, including authentication, authorization, and data protection.
* **Performance:** Optimize the platform for performance, especially in terms of database queries and UI rendering.
* **Scalability:** Design the platform to handle increasing workloads and user numbers.
* **Testing:** Write comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to ensure quality.
* **Deployment:** Establish a reliable deployment process, including CI/CD pipelines.
* **Documentation:** Create clear and concise documentation for developers and administrators.

## Backend architecture

Let's delve deeper into the backend architecture for your software platform. Given your choice of Rust and PostgreSQL, we can design a robust and efficient system. Here's a breakdown of key considerations and potential approaches:

**1. Core Structure**

*   **Modularity:**  Embrace Rust's module system to organize code into logical units, mirroring the modularity of your platform. Each module can encapsulate specific functionality (e.g., user management, module loading, database access).
*   **Layering:**  Structure the backend in layers:
  *   **API Layer:**  Handles requests from the frontend, performs validation, and orchestrates business logic.
  *   **Service Layer:**  Contains the core business logic, interacting with the repository layer.
  *   **Repository Layer:**  Abstracts database interactions, providing an interface for data access.

**2. Data Handling**

*   **ORM (Object-Relational Mapper):**  Consider using an ORM like Diesel or SQLx to simplify database interactions. ORMs provide an abstraction over SQL, allowing you to work with database entities as Rust objects.
  *   **Diesel:**  A popular choice for Rust, offering type-safety and compile-time query validation.
  *   **SQLx:**  Another strong option, supporting asynchronous database operations and multiple database backends.
*   **Database Schema:**  Design a well-structured database schema to support your platform's entities and relationships. Consider using database migrations to manage schema changes over time.

**3. API Design**

*   **RESTful API:**  Design a RESTful API to expose the platform's functionality to the frontend. Use clear and consistent naming conventions for endpoints and data formats.
*   **Serialization:**  Use a serialization library like `serde` to convert Rust data structures to JSON for API responses and vice versa.

**4. Module Management**

*   **Module Loading:**  Implement a mechanism for dynamically loading modules from a git reposytory. This could involve:
  *   Loading modules from a designated directory that should default to `addons`.
*   **Dependency Resolution:**  Develop a system to resolve dependencies between modules, ensuring that required modules are loaded in the correct order. If the module defined in the manifest does not exist during build, download it from the git repository and update the `Cargo.toml` file.

**5. Security**

*   **Authentication:**  Implement secure authentication mechanisms, such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth 2.0, to protect API endpoints.
*   **Authorization:**  Enforce authorization rules to control access to platform resources based on user roles and permissions.
*   **Data Validation:**  Thoroughly validate all incoming data to prevent security vulnerabilities like SQL injection.

**6. Performance and Scalability**

*   **Asynchronous Programming:**  Leverage Rust's async/await capabilities to handle concurrent requests efficiently.
*   **Caching:**  Implement caching strategies to reduce database load and improve response times.
*   **Connection Pooling:**  Use a connection pool to manage database connections efficiently.

**7. Error Handling**

*   **Robust Error Handling:**  Implement comprehensive error handling throughout the backend to provide informative error messages and prevent crashes.
*   **Logging:**  Use a logging library like `log` or `tracing` to record events and errors for debugging and monitoring.

## Module Loading Mechanism

Let's explore module loading mechanisms in the context of your Rust backend. Here's a breakdown of key concepts and potential approaches:

**1. Dynamic Linking vs. Static Linking**

*   **Dynamic Linking:** Modules are compiled into separate shared libraries (`.so` files on Linux, `.dll` files on Windows). These libraries are loaded at runtime when needed. This allows for smaller initial application size and the ability to update modules independently. Some complexity might be added by the fact that the database pool might be difficult to share between the main application and the modules.
*   **Static Linking:** Modules are compiled directly into the main application executable. This results in a larger executable size but can improve performance by eliminating the overhead of dynamic linking.

For your platform, dynamic linking is likely the preferred approach due to its flexibility and support for runtime module loading.

**2. Module Discovery**

*   **Designated Directory:** Define a specific directory (e.g., `addons/`) where modules are stored. The platform can scan this directory at startup or on demand to discover available modules.
*   **Configuration File:** Use a configuration file (e.g., `modules.toml`) to specify the location of modules. This allows for more flexibility in organizing modules.

**3. Loading Mechanisms**

*   **`libloading`:** This Rust crate provides a safe and convenient way to load shared libraries at runtime. You can use it to load module code and access its functions and data.
*   **Custom Loader:** You can implement a custom module loader tailored to your platform's specific needs. This gives you more control over the loading process but requires more development effort.

**4. Module Initialization**

*   **Initialization Function:** Define a standard initialization function (e.g., `init_module()`) that each module must export. This function can be called by the platform to initialize the module and register its functionality.
*   **Metadata:** Require modules to provide metadata (e.g., in a `module.json` file) that describes the module's dependencies, API endpoints, and other relevant information.

**5. Dependency Management**

*   **Dependency Graph:** Build a dependency graph to represent the relationships between modules. This graph can be used to ensure that modules are loaded in the correct order and to detect circular dependencies.
*   **Versioning:** Implement a versioning scheme for modules to manage compatibility and updates.

**6. Security Considerations**

*   **Sandboxing:** Consider using sandboxing techniques to isolate modules and prevent them from interfering with each other or the core platform.
*   **Code Signing:** Implement code signing to verify the authenticity and integrity of modules.
